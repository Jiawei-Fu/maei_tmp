\arguments{
\item{vr}{a data frame contains variables: district and corresponding the number of voters in the district.}

\item{dist}{a character to specify the column name of the district variable in the vr.}

\item{nvoters}{a character to specify the column number of the number of voters in the vr.}

\item{cluster}{a character to to specify the column number of the cluster variable in the vr.}

\item{Z}{a vector to denote the treatment assignments.}

\item{s10}{a number or vector to denote the individuals exposed to the treatment because it is assigned experimentally. It can be the exact number or proportion (between 0 and 1).}

\item{s01}{a number or vector to denote theindividuals not exposed to the treatment because is assigned experimentally. It can be the exact number or proportion (between 0 and 1). Default value is NUll which means it is the case one  in which a researcher designs and implements an intervention that would otherwise not have occurred. If it is not NUll, it means case 2 in which some intervention by an NGO or IG is modified to include an experimental component.}

\item{exp_ac0}{a number or vector to denote the expectation of untreated potential outcome. The default value is one which will return the most conservative bound.}

\item{a}{number or vector to to measure researchersâ€™ ex-ante beliefs about the proportion of voters that could respond to treatment (or some manifestation thereof) in clusters where allocation of the intervention is not changed by the experiment.}
